# Negative-results ledger

This is the durable record of rejected, bounded, consumed, or abandoned ideas.
It prevents a pruned implementation from taking its conclusion with it. Nothing
here is promoting evidence; the linked artifacts and reports remain the primary
records.

When pruning a concluded lane, retain the reusable conclusion here or point to
another durable record. Do not preserve dead code or tests merely to preserve a
postmortem.

## IPMNIST optimizer and update-rule results

1. **Learning rates do not transfer across update geometries.** The initial
   normalized, orthogonalized, and sign-update arms failed at the champion's
   raw-gradient learning rate. Smaller calibrated rates recovered their short
   diagnostics, so the original failure was scale mismatch rather than a useful
   algorithm comparison. Record:
   [`shards_draft_updrule_lr001/`](../../outputs/ipmnist_screening/shards_draft_updrule_lr001/).

2. **RFF bandwidth and input clipping are load-bearing.** The original RFF/RLS
   control failed with an oversized bandwidth and extreme z-scores. A smaller
   bandwidth plus clipping recovered the method. Do not interpret the draft as
   evidence against RFF/RLS, and do not feed near-zero-variance pixels into a
   phase map without a finite range. Record:
   [`shards_draft_rff_gamma005/`](../../outputs/ipmnist_screening/shards_draft_rff_gamma005/).

3. **Perturbation noise is not additive to good input conditioning.** It was
   useful on raw inputs, roughly neutral with slow conditioning, and harmful
   with fast conditioning. Record: `frontier2_results.json` and the addendum in
   [the theory note](../research/ipmnist-theory.md).

4. **The input-normalizer search is closed around a broad 0.98–0.99 decay
   plateau.** Slower and faster decays lost, hidden-layer RMS normalization
   hurt, and epsilon/gate-temperature/local-gate variants were flat. Records:
   [`frontier_results.json`](../../outputs/ipmnist_screening/frontier_results.json)
   and
   [`frontier2_results.json`](../../outputs/ipmnist_screening/frontier2_results.json).

5. **`guarded_cbp_adam` refuted its preregistered prediction.** Eliminating the
   three targeted failure modes with zero coupling did not beat the conditioned
   control. Protection helped only where tasks recurred. Record: the outcome
   matrix in [the theory note](../research/ipmnist-theory.md).

6. **Conditioning and Adam's second moment are partly redundant.** Adding EMA
   normalization to the AdamW+CBP arm did not add the independent benefit seen
   under SGD. Treat the conditioning and tuning gains as alternatives until a
   new experiment separates them. Record: the theory note.

7. **The current mechanism family does not support a 0.95 target.** The stored
   ceiling analysis places the practical protocol-pure ceiling below that
   target. Record:
   [`CEILING_ANALYSIS.md`](../../outputs/ipmnist_screening/CEILING_ANALYSIS.md).

8. **The proxy/full-lane bitwise-equivalence claim is false.** Batched and
   unbatched XLA executions diverge by a few ulps and the long nonlinear run
   amplifies that drift. Paired comparisons within one runner remain useful;
   cross-runner prefix equality does not. Record:
   [`AUDIT.md`](../../outputs/ipmnist_screening/AUDIT.md).

9. **The Wave-A update-rule arms all lost at the campaign horizon.** Muon was
   the strongest adversarial control but still lost to input conditioning;
   column normalization won short diagnostics and then degraded; sign updates
   lost substantially. Do not use two-task rank as a 60-task selector. Record:
   [`waveA_results.json`](../../outputs/ipmnist_screening/waveA_results.json).

10. **Plain exponential-forgetting RLS is unsafe on sparse learned ReLU
    features.** With `lambda < 1`, covariance grew along quiet directions and
    eventually overflowed. `lambda = 1`, detector-driven covariance resets, or
    an explicit covariance cap avoided that failure. Small ridge values also
    won short diagnostics but produced partial long-horizon collapse. Record:
    [`summary_rls_head.json`](../../outputs/ipmnist_screening/summary_rls_head.json).

11. **The RLS readout alone did not move the within-task plateau.** The stable
    residual-trained-body variant did; the unstable forgetting-head version
    failed earlier because body/head feedback amplified head error. The useful
    mechanism is the error signal propagated through a stable head, not merely
    replacing the readout. Record:
    [`summary_rls_head_confirm.json`](../../outputs/ipmnist_screening/summary_rls_head_confirm.json).

12. **Detector-driven covariance reset is load-bearing for the selected
    residual RLS head.** The permanently nonpromoting issue-#184 development
    screen remeasured the reset incumbent and the otherwise identical no-reset
    arm for seeds 0, 1, and 2. Candidate-minus-incumbent online-accuracy
    differences were `[-0.008220, -0.007950, -0.008033]`; their mean was
    `-0.00806778150000013` (standard error `0.00007982303614743532`). Every
    seed was negative and the mean crossed the frozen `-0.002` threshold, so
    the preregistered outcome is `reset_load_bearing`. The source was commit
    `2f4f92afbdfea9f6b48144734f378b2af0987c60`, tree
    `65b8390fd430149ddcca80ea8da75e1782ac8e3b`; GitHub Actions run
    `32096417545` produced artifact `9310391499` (download SHA-256
    `e15416fba53a3f1f408356da4748c3e19382447df17647c1a5c3de35ccf15ef8`).
    The no-reset arm is retired from the live screening registry. This result
    is development-only and cannot support scientific promotion. Record:
    [`rls_preset_ablation_r1/`](../../outputs/ipmnist_screening/rls_preset_ablation_r1/).

13. **Naive Bayes did not remove the post-permutation transient.** Its flat
    task-average curve hid poor early shifted-step performance, so ordinary
    voting added little. Resetting the member's annealing clock helped, but the
    per-example champion/NB oracle still bounded a two-member ensemble below
    the target. First-order permutation assignment also missed its method gate
    at 500 samples. Records:
    [`summary_nb_ensemble.json`](../../outputs/ipmnist_screening/summary_nb_ensemble.json),
    [`summary_naive_bayes.json`](../../outputs/ipmnist_screening/summary_naive_bayes.json),
    and [`V1_assignment.md`](../../outputs/new_directions/V1_assignment.md).

14. **Second-order permutation fingerprints cost more samples than they save.**
    Pairwise pixel-pixel correlation reduced to per-pixel descriptors (row-sum,
    sorted top-16 profile, leading-8 spectral embedding) missed the same
    500-sample gate V1 missed, and by a wider margin: best 0.081 relevant-pixel
    accuracy at N=500 against V1's own class-conditional 0.785. The measured
    sample floor `N*` is `> 2000` for every reduction and both solvers, so the
    family does not beat the ~2,000-sample information floor V1 established.
    All three recover 1.000 from exact full-dataset statistics, so the
    reductions are sound and the constraint is the estimator: a 784x784
    correlation matrix has rank <= N at these budgets. Second-order structure
    is unusable at this budget, not in principle. V2 remains gated out. Record:
    [`V4_fingerprints.md`](../../outputs/new_directions/V4_fingerprints.md).

15. **A shared network cannot fingerprint where a pixel used to live.** The
    model-side arm of the same pre-registration (input-hidden correlation and
    gradient coupling) failed its oracle gate at 0.002/0.000 against 0.95 while
    scoring 1.000 on the no-shift control — it recovers the identity map
    perfectly and the true permutation not at all. Because
    `a_h = relu(sum_k x_k w1[k,h])`, the coupling of input position `j` is
    dominated by the weight *at* `j`, so both sides' descriptors reduce to rows
    of `w1` and matching returns `j -> j`. This is recorded as a confounded
    construction, **not** as evidence against model-side probes: the arm was
    void, so no claim about that family is licensed. A corrected probe must
    score post-shift content against reference-side weights rather than
    correlating both sides through one forward pass. Supporting diagnostic:
    first-layer activation covariance has participation-ratio effective rank
    6.55-6.82, so the nominal 300 dimensions were under 7. Record:
    [`V4_fingerprints.md`](../../outputs/new_directions/V4_fingerprints.md).

16. **V5 is an invalid preregistered execution, not a model-side result.** Both
    model-side controls failed, which required an abort before online scoring,
    but the archived runner continued and emitted 216 cells. The raw JSON,
    report, and runner remain byte-preserved; every online row is void under
    the literal protocol, and the archived data-dependent promotion field has
    no maintained effect. The F5c sample-floor observation is only a same-stack
    descriptive consistency check using the same MNIST, schedules, and seeds
    with a stronger hybrid batch estimator—not an independent replication.
    The structural interpretation is restricted to novel permutations;
    recurrence can replace per-pixel identification with repeat recognition.
    Entry 15 therefore remains open. Record:
    [`V5_model_side_amendment.v1.md`](../../outputs/new_directions/V5_model_side_amendment.v1.md).

17. **V6 remains an inconclusive three-seed development observation.** The raw
    runner checked family separation only for seed 0 before executing its 36
    cells. An append-only audit reconstructs the deterministic schedule control
    for all exact seeds without learner execution: M1 has 100 distinct
    permutations and M4 exactly five for each of seeds 0, 1, and 2. A bound
    matching-config Bayes summary supplies per-seed values `0.983350`,
    `0.988170`, and `0.981415`; their matched mean is `0.9843116667`, making
    Bayes minus the best M4 mean `0.2460436667`. All six registered arm gaps
    were positive on all three consumed seeds, but that is the complete claim
    scope. The post-hoc 7.9x grouping is not retained as causal or primary, and
    this micro recurrence result is not IPMNIST headroom because IPMNIST has no
    repeating permutation. Missing complete historical runtime, dependency,
    and invocation identity keeps the result inconclusive and permanently
    nonpromoting. Record:
    [`V6_recurrence_headroom_amendment.v1.md`](../../outputs/new_directions/V6_recurrence_headroom_amendment.v1.md).

18. **The champion's RLS residual-body gate is not load-bearing at 60 tasks,
    and gate removal did not clear the escalation bar.** A pre-registered
    n=10 paired screen (issue #1937, both arms remeasured on one runner, seeds
    0-9) measured `rls_head_resid_l1_preset005_nogate` at
    +0.001712 ± 0.000174 over `rls_head_resid_l1_preset005` with all ten
    per-seed diffs positive (9.84x stderr), consistent with the earlier n=3
    result in issue #52 but below the frozen +0.002 win bar. The ambiguous-band
    rule therefore applied: no 200-task confirmation, no evaluation-seed touch,
    no threshold move. The recorded fact is that gate removal is a consistently
    not-worse, 2.9x cheaper mechanism at 60 tasks (about 129 s vs about 375 s
    per shard on CPU), not a promoted result. Records:
    `outputs/ipmnist_screening/gate_ablation_r2/` (20 v2 shards, `summary.json`,
    per-shard logs).

19. **Whitening the residual body signal by the head's activation second
    moment is harmful, and the correct feature-space curvature is not enough.**
    A pre-registered 60-task, seeds 0-2 paired screen against a remeasured
    `rls_head_resid_l1_preset005` replaced the body's error direction
    `g = wout @ err` with an interpolation toward a preconditioned direction,
    renormalized to `||g||` so the frozen step size still applied. The two
    metrics are monotone in the interpolation weight and have opposite signs:
    activation whitening (`p @ g`) measured -0.000279 at a=0.5 and -0.001461
    at a=1, while the feature-space Newton direction
    (`wout @ gram^-1 err`, `gram = wout.T @ wout`) measured +0.000011 at
    a=0.5 and +0.001672 at a=1 (all three seeds improving, se 0.000299).
    Since the arms are identical apart from the preconditioning matrix and
    both reduce bitwise to the incumbent at a=0, this isolates the effect to
    the choice of metric: `p` is the activation second moment, whereas the
    loss curvature in `phi` is `wout @ wout.T`. The Newton arm is a real
    effect and still fell in the ambiguous band below the frozen +0.002 win
    bar, so nothing was escalated and no threshold moved. It is also ~6% of
    the 0.0289 needed for the 0.90 target. Plasticity was unmoved across all
    arms (0.0053-0.0178, late-window slopes ~-3e-4). Records:
    `outputs/ipmnist_screening/precond_r1/` (21 v2 shards, `summary.json`,
    `PREREGISTRATION.md`, `RESULTS.md`).

20. **Bounded forgetting still does not pay on the residual RLS head.** The
    untested cell of the head 2x2 — `rls_head_resid_l0999_pcap`, forgetting
    0.999 carrying the residual body signal under BOTH wind-up guards at once
    (trace cap 1e4 and the detector-driven P reset) — led the incumbent on
    every task of a 3-task diagnostic (0.7774/0.8704/0.8744 vs
    0.7324/0.8424/0.8558) and then decayed to +0.000586 at 60 tasks with one
    of three seeds negative. The guards do prevent the float32 overflow
    collapse of negative result #10, but they do not make `lambda < 1` pay:
    the "wins short diagnostics, then fades" pattern reproduces at the
    60-task horizon. Do not re-probe forgetting on this head without a
    mechanism that changes the long-horizon behaviour, and do not rank
    rls_head arms on 2-3 task diagnostics — the ordering inverted between 3
    and 60 tasks in this screen. Record:
    `outputs/ipmnist_screening/precond_r1/`.

21. **The 60-task screen overstates 200-task effect sizes in the rls_head
    family (~3.5x).** The Newton+nogate composition won the 60-task screen
    twice (+0.0027, 15/15 seed-diffs positive) and failed its preregistered
    200-task confirmation at +0.0008 — a valid rejection, and a measured
    calibration warning: treat 60-task paired effects as upper bounds until
    confirmed at horizon. Records:
    `outputs/ipmnist_screening/precond_r2/`.

22. **The identifier match-time star is closed at 50/200/2000.** Round 2
    probed both remaining directions from the confirmed optimum: an earlier
    first match (N=25, ~0.10 accuracy) measured -0.000129 — the family's
    first negative arm, locating the accuracy floor between 0.10 and 0.20 —
    and a faster refine schedule (50/100/500) measured +0.000371, below the
    tie floor. Neither an earlier first match nor a faster refine adds
    anything at +/-0.0004 resolution; the round-1 monotonicity bottomed out
    exactly at N=50. Do not re-tune the match schedule; remaining headroom
    in this family lies elsewhere (the 0.016 to the 0.933 asymptote is
    within-task convergence, untouched by identification). Records:
    `outputs/ipmnist_screening/identmap_star2_r1/`.

21. **Composing the Newton direction with gate removal cleared the 60-task
    bar and then failed confirmation: this mechanism class decays ~3.5x with
    horizon.** `rls_head_resid_l1_preset005_tp_nogate` combines the
    feature-space Newton body signal with issue #1937's gate removal. The two
    are additive with no measurable interaction (-0.000252 +/- 0.000190 at
    n=10, t = -1.33), and additively they cleared the frozen +0.002 win bar
    at 60 tasks: +0.002737 +/- 0.000178 with 10/10 seeds improving and the
    weakest seed at +0.002137. The preregistered 200-task, 20-seed
    confirmation measured **+0.000791 +/- 0.000094 with 19/20 seeds** — a
    **3.46x decay**, failing both the +0.002 bar and the all-seeds condition.
    No new standing best; 0.87114 stands. Both measurements are internally
    sound, so the lesson is about the instrument: the 60-task screen
    overstated the *effect size*, not merely its significance, because the
    gain concentrates in early life and dilutes over a 3.3x longer horizon.
    This extends entry 9 one rung — do not use 60-task paired effects as
    200-task estimates for this class. It also bears on entry 18: gate
    removal is one of the two components here, so its own +0.001712 at 60
    tasks is likely worth substantially less at 200, and the ambiguous-band
    rule that held it back was correct. The remeasured incumbent reproduced
    the standing number to -0.0000658 (inside one stderr) on different
    hardware, so the failure is a property of the arm, not the runner.
    Neither arm degrades: late-window slopes stayed positive (8.03e-05 and
    1.29e-04) and candidate plasticity was slightly higher (0.00745 vs
    0.00448). Records:
    `outputs/ipmnist_screening/precond_r2/` (40 shards, `summary.json`,
    `summary_n10.json`, `PREREGISTRATION.md`) and
    `outputs/ipmnist_screening/precond_confirm_r1/` (40 shards,
    `summary.json`, `RESULTS.md`).

23. **Second-moment body preconditioning under the identmap frame is real
    and too small: it fails the 200-task bar with a 4.66x horizon decay.**
    The first mechanism probe of the 0.016 within-task convergence residue
    after the match-time closure (#22): RMSProp-class per-weight
    preconditioning of the residual body gradient (b2 0.999, eps 1e-8),
    gated and decayed exactly as the incumbent, composed under the
    confirmed identmap50_r identifier — the hypothesis being that the
    identmap-stabilized coordinate frame keeps second moments valid across
    boundaries, unlocking the step-size adaptation the historical Adam
    negatives (all pre-identmap) could not sustain. Step-size calibration
    (3-task, seed 0 only): 0.01 diverged to chance, 0.003 weak, 0.0003 and
    0.001 entered the screen. The 60-task cliff is sharp: sm_step 0.0003
    won +0.005236 on all three seeds while 0.001 lost -0.004799 on all
    three (with doubled plasticity — the noise-amplification failure mode
    onset). The preregistered 200-task, 20-seed confirmation measured
    **+0.0011243 ± 0.000109 with 20/20 seeds positive** — a genuine effect
    at 10.3x stderr that misses the frozen +0.002 bar. The 60t->200t decay
    is 4.66x, steeper than #21's 3.5x, refuting the preregistered
    prediction that a within-task-convergence mechanism decays less than
    an early-life-transient one: even under a stable input frame, the
    preconditioner's gain concentrates in early life, consistent with
    per-weight step adaptation having little to add once body features
    mature. Do not re-probe this mechanism with a smaller step size or a
    boundary reset without reasoning that changes the late-life behaviour;
    the remaining 0.015 to the 0.933 asymptote is not reachable by step
    geometry alone on this evidence. Both arms are deregistered; the
    mechanism and its reduction pins are retained. Records:
    `outputs/ipmnist_screening/smprecond_r1/` (calibration + 9 shards,
    `PREREGISTRATION.md`, `RESULTS.md`) and
    `outputs/ipmnist_screening/smprecond_confirm_r1/` (40 shards,
    `PREREGISTRATION.md`, `RESULTS.md`, `summary.json`).

## Evidence and campaign closures

1. **Continual-IA v1 is a valid rejection at its frozen gate.** Reward uplift
   and both augmentation controls passed; action-changing intervention
   prevalence did not. Consumed-seed replay remains nonpromoting. Record:
   [`outputs/continual_ia/`](../../outputs/continual_ia/).

2. **Kondo compute savings are excluded.** The retired development harness
   performed only post-hoc selection accounting while executing every
   backward update; it never implemented compute gating.

3. **The historical Forager matched campaigns do not support a current
   comparison.** Matched v1 is immutable and source-incompatible; the v2 digest
   is offline-compatibility-only and its selected evaluation produced no batch
   or report. Record:
   [the comparator audit](../archive/forager-comparator-audit.md).

4. **Forager matched v3 was retired before issuance, runtime qualification, or
   full-horizon execution.** It produced no result or evidence. Its unissued
   protocol stack and tests were removed.

5. **UPGD-IPMNIST v3 was retired before issuance or execution.** It produced no
   plan, reservation, shard, artifact, or result and consumed no fresh seed.
   The completed v1/v2 development records remain unchanged; the self-issued,
   permanently nonpromoting governance stack and its tests were removed.

6. **The RTU Taylor correction is a derivation, not exact RTRL under moving
   parameters.** It is parameter-wise diagonal and disabled by default. Record:
   [the derivation](../design/rtu-taylor-correction.md).

7. **The published-scale OPMNIST ingestion lane received no data.** Its unused
   ingestion contract was removed. The separate in-repo 800-task run did
   complete and remains distinct. Record:
   [`step2_opmnist_solution_800task_3seed_PROVENANCE.md`](../../outputs/step2_canonical/step2_opmnist_solution_800task_3seed_PROVENANCE.md).

8. **A registered source mismatch is not a validator bug.** Pinned artifacts
   remain historical records, but they do not certify a current tree whose
   registered bytes differ. Unrelated dirty-worktree changes are not themselves
   a mismatch.

9. **`slowly_changing_regression_v2` is not an exact Dohare et al. (2024)
   replication.** Its comparator was selected locally and its extensions are
   permanently nonpromoting.

10. **The Forager PPO RNG-isolation probe is concluded.** Its finding was
   absorbed into [`FORAGER_BENCHMARK.md`](../../FORAGER_BENCHMARK.md); the
   standalone probe and its code-shape tests were removed.

11. **The compositional future-utility experiments did not justify a default.**
    The first two enabled endpoints lost to the disabled comparator. The v2
    run failed before producing an arm record because of an invalid evaluator
    assertion. The v3 scans completed but report serialization failed on a
    mismatched admissions assertion, so no endpoint, winner, evidence, or
    retry authority exists. Preserve the v3 terminal record; do not reconstruct
    a result from its scans. Record:
    [`one_shot_ledger/`](../../outputs/compositional_future_utility_calibration_v3/one_shot_ledger/)
    and commit `3d195c3` for the retired v1/v2 implementations.

12. **The repeated Prototype option-lifecycle schedule failed at its first
    candidate refresh.** Every proposal selected an incumbent, leaving no
    eligible semantic replacement. It produced no benefit result, and the
    consumed harness was removed. Historical implementation: commit
    `3d195c3`.

13. **The large HCCL/embodied/prototype expansion produced no issued protocol
    or promoted evidence.** It had no robot, active IPMNIST, registry, or
    external consumer, so the implementation-only surfaces and their
    self-referential tests were removed. The same applies to the
    complete-prototype manifest and the not-assessed WP2 matrix: source presence
    was not an empirical gate.

## EMNIST transfer results

1. **Bare input conditioning does not solve label permutation.**
   `sgd_ema_norm` lost clearly to UPGD-W on L/P EMNIST. The utility gate remains
   load-bearing when outputs change even if inputs are stationary.

2. **The conditioning-equivalence prediction was refuted.** In the v2 merge,
   `upgd_ema_norm` exceeded its preregistered equivalence band around the raw
   UPGD-W baseline. EMA conditioning is therefore a general stream optimizer,
   not only an input-shift fix; perturbation again added no benefit once
   conditioning was present. Record: `results.v2.json` in the EMNIST output
   lane.
